# A Framework for Analysing Delays within Public Transport Networks

In this research project we analyze how public transport in South-East Queensland is affected by rain.
We provide a toolkit for historical and live statistical analysis of the current delays in the Translink Bus, Train, Tram and Boat network. For this we leverage the GTSB-RT and RainViewer API.


## Installation

Use conda to install dependencies in requirements.txt

For gdal:
- `conda install -c conda-forge gdal`

This is important as we need prebuild binaries for gdal for georeferencing our radar/satellite data


## Report

Our final report is located at [`./report.pdf`](./report.pdf)

## Data Visualization
